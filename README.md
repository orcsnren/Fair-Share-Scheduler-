The aim of this project is to get started with understanding the Linux kernel. Some of the definitions which were taught during the semester, especially, “user-space/kernel-space”, “system call” and “scheduling” will be practised.
The project is divided in two phases; the first phase is how to add a system call which returns some values (uid, pid, nice, counter and etc.) of the current process, the second will focus on how to implement a fair-share CPU scheduler.
